# Cyberbullying Detection and Analysis in Social Media 

Welcome to our project! This repository powers a web application designed to detect, categorize and analyze cyberbullying in online text — particularly on social media platforms. It doesn't just identify harmful content; it also provides actionable insights and respectful alternatives to promote a healthier digital conversation space.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques to build an intelligent system that:

* Detects cyberbullying from textual data
* Categorizes content based on cyberbullying type
* Flags harmful words
* Provides human-readable justifications and respectful alternatives

We aim to empower users, moderators and platforms to **promote empathy and reduce toxicity** online.

---

## 🔒 Categories of Cyberbullying Detected

* **Identity-based Cyberbullying**: Involves targeting individuals or groups based on inherent personal traits such as:

  * **Race/Ethnicity-related**
  * **Gender/Sexual-related**
  * **Religion-related**

* **Behavior-based Cyberbullying**: Involves harmful conduct irrespective of personal identity, such as:

  * **Harassment**
  * **Flaming/Trolling**
  * **Dissing**

* **Not Cyberbullying**: Content that does not fall under any harmful category.

## 💡 What Does the Website Do?

Given a user-inputted sentence, the platform:

* 🧠 **Detects** whether the text contains cyberbullying.
* 🏷️ **Classifies** the **type** of cyberbullying (e.g., identity-based or behavior-based).
* ☠️ **Flags** specific harmful terms in the sentence.
* 📉 **Calculates** the percentage of harmful content.
* 💬 **Explains** why the sentence is considered harmful.
* 🔄 **Suggests Polite Alternatives** for the user to use instead.

## 🧪 Sample Use-Cases

* 🔍 Detect abusive or hate speech in online comments
* 📊 Analyze social media trends around bullying or harassment
* 🧩 Educational tools to demonstrate the impact of digital abuse
